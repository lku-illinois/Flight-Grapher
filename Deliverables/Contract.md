# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We will have two or three meetings per week,
First one is 3pm Tuesday at CIF -> some progress should be made by Tuesday
Second one is 6pm Thursday at CIF -> to discuss goals achieved, fill out log, and discuss plan for next week
We will also have one optional meeting -> Saturday 6pm at CIF during weekends if any of the  team members face any hardship in their work

2. **Assistance** 
We have a discord group chat so we can communicate with each other.
We should expect a response at least on the same day.

3. **Respect** 
We will use common sense and mutual respect and understanding to make sure everyone can be heard.
We will discuss different ideas and accept constructive criticism.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will dissect different sections of code and distribute them to different teammates based on their abilities.
We will assess each other’s strengths and weaknesses to determine the best tasks for each group member.
We will address unforeseen issues by being adaptable and communicating with each other to determine how to resolve issues quickly.
We will make sure to update the github frequently.

5. **Time Commitment** 
Our group will commit at least 5 hrs per week on this project to make sure we are on track.
We all have stuff to do, but we will all get at least 5 hours per week for the project.
We will notify ahead of time if you face any difficulties or something that prevents work done and communicate well to see who can help or do a bit more that week.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We will elect a captain and follow his instructions. The project will progress smoothly under leadership.
We will communicate frequently and if someone is not doing work or habitually late then we will address the situation and try to work around their schedule or situation.
If someone gets covid, don’t come, can meet over zoom.
